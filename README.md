Flappy Bird Game Using JavaScript and HTML5
Flappy Bird is a game that uses 2D display. The aim is to direct the flying bird, named "Faby", which moves continuously to the right, between sets of pipes like Mario. If a player touches the pipe, they lose. Faby quickly flaps every time the player taps the screen, if the screen doesn't knock, then Faby falls due to gravity. Each pair of pipes he navigates yields one player point, with a medal awarded for a score at the end of the match. No medals are awarded for scores less than ten. Bronze medals are awarded for scores between ten and twenty. To receive a silver medal, players must reach 20 points. Gold medals are given to those whose value is higher than thirty points. Players who reach a score of forty or higher receive a platinum medal.
